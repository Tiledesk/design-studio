Tiledesk is an open-source, no-code development platform for creating chatbots and conversational apps. Our Design Studio, featured in this repository, offers a user-friendly, drag-and-drop interface with pre-ready actions and integrations. This platform combines the power of LLM/GPT AI with a flexible 'graph' approach for creating conversations and automations with ease.
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.2.6.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Important Note: Running Design Studio

Design Studio cannot run as a standalone application; it is tightly integrated with the Tiledesk solution. To set up and use Design Studio, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have an authenticated Tiledesk environment.
2. Add a key `tiledesk_token` to your browser’s local storage with your Tiledesk authentication token.
3. Navigate to your project by accessing the following URL pattern: ``http://loalhost/#/project/<project_id>/chatbot/<chatbot-id>/blocks``

Please note that Design Studio depends on prior authentication through the Tiledesk platform to function correctly. You must have a valid Tiledesk token and project to access and use the tool.
